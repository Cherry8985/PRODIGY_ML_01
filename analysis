Sure, here's a description of the provided code files:

File 1: Data.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file focuses on data preprocessing and analysis for the 'Houseprice' dataset. The steps performed in this notebook include:

1.Importing the 'Houseprice' dataset.
2.Dropping irrelevant columns from the dataset.
3.Checking for zero values in the dataset and converting them to NaN.
4.Imputing the zero values based on the distribution of the column.
5.Rounding the decimal points in the dataset.
6.Converting the "sqft_basement" and "yr_renovated" columns into binary columns and renaming them.
7.Conducting statistical analysis on the dataset columns.
8.Addressing outliers in the columns based on the "Winsorization" technique.
9.Addressing skewness using the "Box-Cox" transformation.
10.Saving the modified data into a file named "After_Modifications.csv".


File 2: LRModel.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file is focused on building and evaluating a linear regression model using the modified dataset prepared in 'Data.ipynb'. The steps performed in this notebook include:

1.Importing the modified data from 'After_Modifications.csv'.
2.Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3.Building a linear regression model and evaluating its performance.
4.Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the top 5 features and building a new linear regression model with these features.
5.Attempting Lasso regression and cross-validation techniques to increase the model's accuracy.
6.These notebooks provide a comprehensive pipeline for preparing the dataset, building a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance using various techniques. They serve as a guide for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation tasks in machine learning projects.
